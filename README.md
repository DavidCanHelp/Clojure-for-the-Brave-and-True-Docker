# Clojure-for-the-Brave-and-True-Docker
This repo backs a Docker Hub build to have a working dev environment for going through the book by Daniel Higginbotham, "Clojure for the Brave and True"

## Motivation

I'm reading through Clojure for the Brave and True again, and I'm realizing that configuring my environment for the book vs configuring my environment
for work could use a little bit of separation of concerns. These are those concerns, in a format I can share with others and migrate between machines.
