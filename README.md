# Clojure-for-the-Brave-and-True-Docker

This repo backs a Docker Hub build to have a working dev environment for going
through the book by Daniel Higginbotham, "Clojure for the Brave and True"

## Motivation

I'm reading through Clojure for the Brave and True again, and I'm realizing that
configuring my environment for the book vs configuring my environment for work
could use a little bit of separation of concerns. These are those concerns, in a
format I can share with others and migrate between machines.


## Usage

You'll need [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on
the machine where you'd like to run this. That can be on your local Linux, Mac,
Windows, or Windows WSL instance, or even in the cloud on a
[DigitalOcean Droplet](https://m.do.co/c/b691120bf5f9) (that referral link gives
you $100 credit on DigitalOcean to use over 60 days).
